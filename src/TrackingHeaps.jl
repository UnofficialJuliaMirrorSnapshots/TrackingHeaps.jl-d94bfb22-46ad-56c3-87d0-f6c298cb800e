"""
TrackingHeaps offers a heap with a tracking system for the stored values.

Inserting a value into a TrackingHeap returns a tracker for the value. The
tracker can be used to access, update, and delete the value without searching
for it first. Heap order do not allow for `O(log m)` search (where `m` is the
number of values currently stored inside the heap), just for `O(m)` search, so
this feature allow for some performance gain if you need to manipulate values
anywhere in the heap (not just on top of the heap). Besides access, which is
`O(1)`, update and delete are `O(log m)` as they may need to rebalance the
tree.

If the tracking system is not needed, there is little reason to use this heap.

I wrote this package because the MutableBinaryHeap of DataStructures.jl did not
allow some behavior I wanted; behavior as:
1) a non-top value can be deleted without being made top first;
2) convenience methods allow to `pop!`/`delete!` stored values and
   immediatelly `track!` others, avoiding double-rebalancing;
3) after a value is deleted, its tracker can be re-reused to re-insert
   that value or insert a new value (but this is not done automatically);
4) the arity of the heap (binary, trinary, etc..) can be defined by the
   user (by parametric type) and inccur in minimal overhead (I hope);
5) all the stored values are in a `Vector{V}` in heap order, for easy
   backdoor/hacking access;
6) the integer type that is the tracker type can be defined by the user.
"""
module TrackingHeaps
# TODO: To allow automatic reuse create a different heap, as the struct would
#       need an extra vector for the "already used but expired" trackers.
#       Such vector could be reset if the heap becomes empty at any time,
#       and values removed from its back do not need to be added there.
# TODO: doctests (https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/documentation/)
# TODO: (to be considered) track the largest tracker not expired, when it is
#       removed search for the second largest, and resize tk2ix accordingly.
#       This can make a single removal O(num calls to track! already done), but
#       if we search using tk2ix, then it is amortized (for each extra step in
#       some deletion, there should have been a previous track!, and the extra
#       steps consume such "savings" made by previous track!). This assumes
#       the user will not use setindex! to insert values with large
#       tracker keys.
# TODO: for now, tracker keys cannot be of a !isbits type,
#       because for efficiency/convenience we convert the N-arity to the type
#       of K and then dispatch on it with Val, but Val (or any parametric type)
#       cannot wrap !isbits types.

    is_higher_than(HeapOrderType, x, y) :: Bool

To define an ordering that is not the stored value type (i.e., `V`) default,
you can create a new empty type and extend the `is_higher_than` function with a
method that takes such empty type and returns if `x` should be higher in the
heap than `y` based on it (so you do not need to wrap the value type inside a
new type for a different ordering).

Note that `is_higher_than` defaults to `<` and `>` instead of `isless` and
`!isless` (that would be `>=`).

Also, if you do not want to provide a `<` and `>` for the stored value type,
you can instead just define this function for `::Type{MinHeapOrder}` (and/or
`::Type{MaxHeapOrder}`) and `x`-and-`y` of the specific types of the values
compared.

    TrackingHeap{K, V, N, O, S} <: AbstractDict{K, V}

The type of a heap that has tracker/keys of type K (an integer), stored values

O, and the safety level defined by S.

Equal values are allowed but, if more than one value could be the top value,
then any of the equal values may be there (they can yet be distinguished by
tracker).

The TrackingHeap implements (almost) all methods described in Dict interface,
and can be seen as a Dict (with the special property of always allowing for
fast access to the minimal/maximal value and its key). There is an AbstractHeap
of DataStructures, but it was designed for heaps without key, and then
an AbstractMutableHeap interface (for heaps with keys) was grafted into it.
Also, inheriting such interface would make necessary that this package
used DataStructures just for inheriting its abstract type.
